    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>1 cup of sour cream</li>
        <li>1 cup of shredded cheddar</li>
        <li>fresh chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps of Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li>While the oven is heating, clean your potatoes thoroughly under cold water. Use a brush if necessary to remove any dirt, then pat them dry.</li>
        <li>Prick each potato several times with a fork. This helps steam escape and prevents the potatoes from bursting in the oven.</li>
        <li>Rub the potatoes with olive oil, then season them with salt and pepper. Make sure they're fully covered.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet. Bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until the skin is crispy and the insides feel soft when probed with a fork.</li>
        <li>Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Once they're cool enough to handle, cut a small slit in the top of each potato. Be careful not to cut all the way through.</li>
        <li>Using a fork, fluff the inside of each potato. The goal is to break up the flesh and make it easier to mix with the toppings.</li>
        <li>Top each potato with a tablespoon of butter and let it melt into the warm potato.
        </li>
        <li>Add a quarter cup of sour cream and a quarter cup of shredded cheddar cheese to each potato.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped chives, then serve while they're still warm. Enjoy your delicious baked potatoes!</li>
    </ol>
